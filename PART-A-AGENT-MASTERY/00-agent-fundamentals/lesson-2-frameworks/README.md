### What are AI Agent Frameworks?

AI Agent Frameworks are **architectural systems** that provide **structured approaches** to building **intelligent agents** by offering **abstractions, patterns, and tools** for implementing the core agent components we studied in Lesson 1.

#### Framework as Architectural Philosophy

Each framework embodies a specific theoretical approach to agent construction:

1. **Abstraction Layer** - How the framework hides complexity
   - Example: CrewAI abstracts multi-agent coordination as "crews"
2. **Programming Model** - How developers express agent behavior
   - Example: LangGraph uses graph-based workflow representation
3. **Execution Model** - How the framework runs agent operations
   - Example: Ray provides distributed execution primitives
4. **Integration Philosophy** - How the framework connects to external systems
   - Example: LangChain emphasizes broad ecosystem connectivity
